                    Tech-a-thlon 2.0 consisted of 3 rounds.
                    Info-a-thon: A general quiz on the G20 summit was conducted on
                    Quizizz. It was a time-based quiz. Judging was done based on the
                    number of correct and timely answers. At the end of round 1,
                    parcipants with lower scores were eliminated. Debug-a-palooza: 
                    It was a debugging competition held on google forms, where the
                    parcipants were tested on their knowledge of coding and its
                    intricacies. Each parcipant was given a problem that either had an
                    error or that did not produce the intended effect, they had to read
                    and rewrite only a few lines of code to fix these problems.
                    Code-a-thon: In this round parcipants were given various problems
                    sorted according to their difficulty, they had to solve these problems
                    with the best of their abilies keeping in mind the time and space
                    complexity.

                    The event was a seminar led by Mr Harshit Gaur, who
                    explained to the students about what ML and AI is all about, intriguing
                    their interest in the domain. He then walked the students through a
                    proper roadmap of how to begin their journey of AI and ML. A quiz was
                    also conducted by BQC in the middle of the event, around the topics
                    discussed by our speaker. We had three winners who were awarded
                    goodies. Toward the end of the session, our speaker Also demonstrated
                    real-time working ML AI projects that allowed the students to get a better
                    understanding of how applied machine learning works.

                    You don't need to have a 100-person company to develop that idea. A quote by Larry Page that was justified when Plan2Hack, a 9-hour offline Hackathon and Business plan competition, was organized by IEEE BVCOE, the IEEE student branch of Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering on 12th May 2022. Defying all odds and setting new trends, it got over 1000 registrations from all over India. Our generous sponsors helped us in generating a prize pool worth Rs 30,000.

                    Drishti SIGs.
                    <br/>
                    The workshop took place on 28.12.2018-4.01.2019 in the library. The focus of the workshop was to recreate the natural
                    phenomena- aurora a.k.a. Northern lights using drones and light painting techniques and finally draw shapes, patterns
                    and images in the sky. Siddhart Talia (Makers Head) along with Kshitij Sidana (RnD Head, RAS) initiated the workshop by
                    explaining students about drones, the various components that go into its making and related concepts such as control
                    algorithms and path planning. Kshitij then apprised the students about photography concepts like ISO, shutter speed,
                    exposure and f-stop. The later days of the workshop witnessed the presence of E-cell Head, who inspired the students to
                    use this knowledge and come up with solutions to everyday problems with the goal of building a start-up. Towards the end
                    of the series, students implemented the concepts learnt and drew some images in the sky using the technique of light
                    painting, accomplished by the use of drones having autonomous capabilities.
                    <br/>
                    With a footfall of 64 attendees from different colleges, all geared up to apply the concepts learnt about 3D printing,
                    architecture, project planning, drone delivery, transportation and various other fields, the workshop was a big success.
